Pokémon GridWorld
==================
A basic port of Pokémon into GridWorld.

Building
--------
GridWorld.jar must be in your build path to run properly.

Running
-------
The only deviation from a "standard" GridWorld program is Trainer creation.  A "blank" trainer is built using a custom interface.
