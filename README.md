Pokémon GridWorld
==================
A basic port of Pokémon into GridWorld.

Building
--------
Using ant:
```
$ ant dist
```

Using Eclipse:
File -> New -> Project -> Java Project from Existing Ant Build File

Running
-------
The only deviation from a "standard" GridWorld program is Trainer creation.  A "blank" trainer is built using a custom interface.
